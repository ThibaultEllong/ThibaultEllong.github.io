#### Sketching the Ideas

The first step in the design process is to sketch the ideas. I went for some already existing AR applications and some others that are yet to be perfected. However, none of those already exist. I sketched them to show how they would look like and how they would work.

- The first idea is a hand menu that can be used by raising a finger and clicking with the other hand. That would give access to a wide range of action buttons quickly.
- The second prototype is the concept teased by Apple for the Vision Pro which I find mesmerizing. It is the Gaze-Controlled cursor. It allows for the total removal of controllers.
- The third idea is a Computer Vision controlled assistant that would autonomously recognize objects and guide the users through the process of using them.

This step of the creation process made me realize how hard it is to draw hands.

#### Prototyping

I will prototype the first idea. I used After Effects to create this little visualization:

#### Feedback

I asked my mother about this video and if she understood what was the goal and use for it.

She understood the global concept, how and why it could be used. However, she said that it was quite small and the touch had to be precise. Moreover, she raised the problem of raising multiple fingers: only the index can be raised by itself easily. The other fingers are harder to raise by themselves. So the menu would be hard to use with the other fingers.

I think that this concept is quite intuitive and easy to use but can be improved regarding design and ergonomics with more feedback.
