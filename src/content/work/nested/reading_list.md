#### Computer Vision

Computer Vision is a really diverse branch of the AI/ML research field. It already has and will, in the next few years, become a prominent area of interest and needs for industries and customers alike as more autonomous systems will require a finer and finer understanding of their surroundings. Thus, it is important to stay up-to-date on the latest innovations.
