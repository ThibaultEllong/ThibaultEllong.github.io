This blog post is part of a series of assignment for the Human-Computer Interaction course at Institut Polytechnique de Paris.

I will first present a **research paper exploring the future of HCI and its combination with AI**.

I will then present the concept of **the Ultimate Display by Ivan Sutherland** and its impact on HCI.

Finally, I will discuss about the different **input devices and the interaction paradigms** they induce.

##### Paper: Development of an Eye Tracking-Based Human-Computer Interface for Real-Time Applications
**by Radu Gabriel Bozomitu, Alexandru Păsărică, Daniela Tărniceriu and Cristian Rotariu**

Physically-disabled people, especially those that can't use their upper limbs or hand, have a hard time interacting with computers. Our modern interfaces are focused on hand and finger movements.

In this paper, the researchers investigate the use of pupil detection and eye tracking to create a new interface for disabled people.

The authors evaluated 6 methods for pupil detection by measuring the detection rate. 

**Introduction:**

The introduction of the paper highlights the importance of eye-tracking technology in human-computer interaction and its potential for real-time applications. The authors discuss the challenges associated with developing an accurate and reliable eye-tracking system, including the need for robust pupil detection algorithms and the impact of various factors such as lighting conditions and user ability.

**Methods and Materials:**

The paper goes on to describe the video oculography technique used in the study, which is based on video analysis of eyeball movement using a video camera in the visible or infrared spectrum. The authors explain the advantages and disadvantages of infrared eye image capturing and describe the dark-pupil technique used in their study. The section also provides details on the hardware system for VOG signal acquisition, including the head-mounted eye tracking interface used in the study and the infrared video camera used for eye pupil image acquisition and processing. 

**Conclusion:**

The conclusion adresses the results for the eye detection tasks as well as the eye-controlled interface.

Firstly, the authors evaluated six pupil center detection techniques for accuracy and determined the detection rate within a circular target area. They found that the algorithm based on circular Hough transform was the best for real-time applications. Secondly, the authors presented experimental results for cursor controllability and stability on the user screen. They found that the proposed eye tracking interface provided stable cursor control with an average error of less than 10 pixels. Finally, the authors presented an application of the system, a low-cost eye typing application using a virtual keyboard. The results showed that the proposed system achieved a typing speed of 20.74 words per minute with an accuracy of 96.7%.
