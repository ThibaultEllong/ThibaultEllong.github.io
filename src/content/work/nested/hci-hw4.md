#### The Shape of the Future Smartphone

The advent of mobile phones has revolutionized the way humans communicate and interact, heralding an era of rapid technological growth that has pushed the boundaries of innovation. Tracing the trajectory of this evolution, one cannot help but marvel at the pace of development that has led to the smartphone era. This article examines the journey of mobile phones to smartphones, with particular reference to changes in their shape. A thoughtful look into potential future evolution of the smartphone is also presented, alongside plausible explanations for such trajectories.

The initial phase of mobile phones dates back to the early 1970s, mostly characterized by bulky car telephones. The “brick” phones of the 1980s, named for their large, heavy demeanors, followed suit. They offered basic communication services and were considered a symbol of status and privilege. However, it was the 1990s that saw a significant shift in shape with flip phones and slider phones gaining popularity, largely because of media and pop culture references. This shift was necessitated by the consumer demands for compact, more portable devices.

The transition from these early mobile phone models to sleek and user-friendly smartphones has been dictated by advances in technology and consumer needs, particularly in the 21st century. Unsurprisingly, these pressures have defined the shape of smartphones in the context of improved aesthetics, usability and portability.

The evolution of the smartphone has seen devices shrink from the size of bricks to sleek objects fitting comfortably in the palm of a hand or pockets. Aspects of user interactiveness, made possible through the introduction of high-resolution touch screens, paved the way for the rectangular 'candy bar' design. This design not only improved aesthetics but also facilitated easy web browsing, gaming, reading, and multitasking.

Battery concerns, demand for larger screens for media consumption, and the focus on slim designs have also influenced the evolution of smartphones' shape, and will likely continue to do so. However, we have recently seen a re-emergence of foldable technology with phones like Samsung Galaxy Fold and the Motorola Razr 2019. This resurgence embodies the quest for versatility, merging both portability and large screen sizes, thus heralding the future trajectory of smartphones.

So, what does the future hold for smartphones? It’s envisaged that advances in areas such as flexible display technologies, miniaturization, and wireless technology could significantly influence future smartphone design. With tech giants like Samsung and Huawei already showcasing foldable smartphones, it's beyond dispute that flexible displays are the future. This scale of flexibility could, intelligibly, lead to completely foldable or rollable smartphones, offering users larger screens without compromising portability.

In conclusion, the evolution of mobile phones into highly sophisticated smartphones has been immensely influenced by technological advancements and consumer demands. The shape evolution, in particular, has been geared towards enhancing functionality, aesthetics, and portability. Going forward, smartphones are likely to adopt more flexible and compact forms as technology expands the boundaries of possibilities with foldable, rollable, and even wearable designs becoming more perfectly evolved realities than sci-fi fantasies. Therefore, the future of smartphones hinges on striking a balance between practical and physical design considerations, user needs, and the implementation of innovative technology.
