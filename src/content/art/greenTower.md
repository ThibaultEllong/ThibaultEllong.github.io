### The Green Tower

As a new addition to my cyberpunk art serie, this artwork is a darker twist on the already usually moody and ominous cyberpunk genre. I really enjoy doing such oppressive and mysterious pieces as they are simple yet visually powerful.

This was inspired by the artwork from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1i0f1WYigc&t=1184s&ab_channel=FocusSoundscapes).
