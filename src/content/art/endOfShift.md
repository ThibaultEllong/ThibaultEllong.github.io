### End of Shift

This artwork constitutes my final project for my master's Blender course. As I had creative freedom, I decided to make art I enjoy doing outside of class.

It is heavily inspired by the cyberpunk aesthetic which is a genre born in the 80s and popularized by movies such as Blade Runner and Akira. 

It is quite a peculiar genre as it is both futuristic and retro at the same time. 

Moreover, I find it quite hypocritical as it depicts a grungy dystopian future where crime and poverty are rampant, buildings blend with the clouds as the sky is a long forgotten memory and in which nature is just pictures on a screen. 
However, it is also an aesthetic that is very pleasing to the eye and that can be quite relaxing and appeasing at times. 

Its sometimes colorful and sometimes dark neon lights and its futuristic yet retro architecture make it a very interesting genre to explore.
