### The Facility

This piece is part of a eco-brutalism serie in which I mix nature and brutalist architecture. I love the contrasting philosophies of nature and brutalism which is an architectural style that is probably the furthest from anything natural. 

Brutalism is a post-WW2 movement born in the 50s and popularized in the 60s. It is characterized by its raw and unrefined look. It is often associated with concrete and steel. Brutalist buildings are often very imposing and massive.

I think that brutalism and cyberpunk share many similarities. They both have a very dystopian and grungy look that is crushing for the soul but also can both offer an almost soothing sense of comfort and security.

This render was made using Blender and Photoshop.
